# The Skate Shop

This project is built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- Netlify

My favorite way to learn is to try and emulate a really cool webiste. This was the first project where I designed in Figma first, then translated the design into code. I had so much fun building this landing page, eventhough I can see a lot of places where I've improved since then. However everytime I visit this page I can feel the ocean breeze in my hair while I zip amongst sun-soaked palm trees on my electric skateboard.
